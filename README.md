The article_scrapper aims at scraping the information from different news article sites. 

Scraping:

The purpose of the this python function is to separate the headlines and the body of each article. 
Once you run the program on an article  for instance, from Fox News. 
The program will use the url for the article we want to scrape and bring back just the 
headline and the body of the article separated. 

Dataframe:

Once the information is scraped then the program goes and compiles all the information
in a dataframe. And then this dataframe is saved in a CSV file that is stored on the local
machine.
